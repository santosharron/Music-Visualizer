# Music-Visualizer
A function featured in electronic music visualizers and media player software that creates animated graphics based on a piece of music is known as music visualization. The picture is frequently created and presented in real-time, in a fashion that is coordinated with the music as it is played.

# Usage
Click on anywhere on the screen to play and once more to pause.

## Known complications with the project:
Due to Chrome's autoplay policy, audio does not play when clicking the screen. A fix I use for this is to run Live Server on VSCode for this project, change something in the code and undo the change for the project to refresh. Audio plays now :D

Perhaps using this method to enable audio playback isn't the ideal way but I wanted to keep things clean for this project (didn't want to have so many buttons around) so I resorted to this method.
